# Chess game enterer

This is a try to learn something about modern JavaScript.

Using existing libraries like [chess.js]() and [Chessground]() I have made a simple
game recorder. You enter manually the game and get the PGN of the game back.

In case you don't have or don't want to install some chess software like Scid or ChessBase.

You can download, open the index.html page in a browser and start playing with it, or use it online at https://erral.github.io/game-enter
